Problem:

You have a movie from the internet, or another source.

You put the movie on a FAT32 flash drive and it does not show up on the PS3 XMB listing.

Example: Cool.Movie.Name.Here.2007-BDRip.mp4


Solution:

There are a few ways that I found to "trick" the PS3 into thinking it is reading an SD Card device, ie; Android, iOS, etc.


-------------------------------------------------
Method #1 (Fake Android Device)

1) Take your flash drive formatted to FAT32 and make a folder called "DCIM" in the root directory. (\DCIM\)

2) Navigate inside that folder and create a new folder named "ANDRO100". (\DCIM\ANDRO100\)
   ** I tried "Camera", listing reads, but not file **

3) Place your "Cool.Movie.Name.Here.2007-BDRip.mp4" into the "\DCIM\ANDRO100\" folder.

4) Rename "Cool.Movie.Name.Here.2007-BDRip.mp4" to "VID_20160417.mp4".
   ** You can use any date probably, I just tested with this one.

   ** There are variations that may also work for the filename **

   - VIDEO0001.mp4

5) Safe Eject the flash drive and put back into PS3.

6) It should now display under Video column in XMB.

Method #2 (Fake iDevice)

** I HAVE NOT TESTED THE IPHONE ONE YET!!! **

1) Take your flash drive formatted to FAT32 and make a folder called "DCIM" in the root directory. (\DCIM\)

2) Navigate inside that folder and create a new folder named "APPLE100". (\DCIM\APPLE100\)
   ** I tried "Camera", listing reads, but not file **

3) Place your "Cool.Movie.Name.Here.2007-BDRip.mp4" into the "\DCIM\ANDRO100\" folder.

4) Rename "Cool.Movie.Name.Here.2007-BDRip.mp4" to "VID_20160417.mp4".

5) Safe Eject the flash drive and put back into PS3.

6) It should now display under Video column in XMB.
